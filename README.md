This project involves creating a Python script that automates the process of generating PDF reports from data files. The script reads data from a given file (e.g., CSV), 
performs basic analysis such as summarizing key metrics or statistics, and then formats the results into a clean, professional PDF report using libraries like FPDF or 
ReportLab. This task demonstrates skills in data handling, basic analysis, and automated document generationâ€”useful for reporting dashboards and data-driven summaries.
